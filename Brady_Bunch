#How do i calculate mode? The Thinkful instructions weren't super clear

#2, i would choose mean because the variance between their age is low so mean gives a more accurate answer.
#Also, I would pick st. dev to measure how close the outliers were to the center as opposed trying to calculate a standard error. There are
# no uncertainties in this data set so expected error wouldn't really apply.

#3 the median and mean both = 10 if Cindy has a birthday.

#4 The mean lowers to 9 if Jessica replaces Oliver. i would choose median because the variance is now larger. 

#5 the 50th anniversary is 2019. Since there are ~325M adults in the USA and ~22% are younger than 18, that = 260M adults in the USA.
