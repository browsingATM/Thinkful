    What is the 1994 rate of juvenile delinquency in the U.S.?
    ->bad, this is too specific and there is probably already well understood or documented.
    -> a better question
    What can we do to reduce juvenile delinquency in the U.S.?
    -> bad, too broad. There are far too many factors to consider. 
    -> A better question would be: which factor most contributes to juvenile delinquincy?

    -> good questions. specific, there is data available on things like graduation rates, etc.

    ->yes it works, there's no need to invent the wheel. Their multi-billion $ business wouldn't exist if it didn't.
