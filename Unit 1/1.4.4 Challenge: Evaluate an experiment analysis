1. Sith "Give In to your Anger."
Problems:
First of all, droids can't go to the dark side...
secondly, you can't hear what vader says well so the speech issue could make it less persuasive.
thirdly, these droids are "captured." probably not the best recruits to hear the message.
fourthly, they're probably afraid Palpatine will "give into his anger" and kill the droid if they don't convert.

Solution: use humans & aliens (just program the droids to do their bidding!), and have both palapatine and Vader give both slogans to 
groups of 50 people to account for bias/performance in the messenger. The lords want high proportional recruitment numbers so whichever 
combo works best is what they should use.

2. Bad Jedi PR
Problems:
-Jar Jar had a favorable audience. And Mace is kind of a scary dude.
-Mace Windu had a high favorability despite the unfavorable audience
-Jar Jar also has a lisp/speaking impediment so he probably should have performed better
-Simpson's paradox--what is to say Jar Jar didn't go a planet and did very well but did mediocre on a few others?
-The same can be said of Mace Windu
-issues per planet can vary and the quality of the messenger may matter a lot or a little.

Solutions:
-send Jar Jar and MAce to two favorable plants and two unfavorable planets.
-present the findings on a per-planet basis.

3. Multi-national Corporations
Problems
-simpsons paradox--avg across all five sites could be inversely related on a per country basis.
-depending on whether one of these departmnets is collecting the data, user bias might more favorably/unfavorably on one side.
-he samples aren't equal since HR is in 3/5 countries while IT is evenly across 5. 
-are 100% of respondents filling out the survey?
--satisfaction can be biased if respondents aren't anonymized

Solutions:
-measure findings on a per country basis and by department
-have independent consultants or another department manage the project to avoid bias.
-compare HR to HR and IT to IT. each sample has different variables and comparing rates isn't significant necessarily.
-ensure 100% responses.
-anonymize the respondents

4. Happy Days Fitness Tracker
Problems:
-the sample is biased--users who want to be tracked likely want to for performance, another reason, or perhaps misunderstood.
-the sample doesn't track the users who didn't opt in. 
-false equivalency that app usage creates higher activity

Solutions:
-in the T&C's, have all users consent to monitoring for a more accurate sample of all users.

5. Teachers stop cheating
Problems: 
-this teacher should have her Masters revoked
-the order of how she gave out the test matters less than the quality of the test themselves
-there may be qualitative characteristics about students who show up in the first 1/3, middle 1/3, and last 1/3 perform that impact results

Solutions:
-have the same test but the questions ordered differently.
