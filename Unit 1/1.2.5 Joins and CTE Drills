-- 1. What are the three longest trips on rainy days?
SELECT
	trips.duration,
	trips.start_date,
	weather.events LIKE 'Rain'
FROM
	trips
JOIN
	weather
ON
	trips.zip_code = weather.zip;
#with rainy as (SELECT date From weather WHERE events = 'Rain' GROUP BY 1 )

-- 2. Which station is full most often?
SELECT

	stations.dockcount,
	trips.start_station,
	trips.end_station
FROM
	stations
JOIN

-- 3.Return a list of stations with a count of number of trips starting at that station 
-- but ordered by dock count.
SELECT

4. (Challenge) What's the length of the longest trip for each day it rains anywhere?
