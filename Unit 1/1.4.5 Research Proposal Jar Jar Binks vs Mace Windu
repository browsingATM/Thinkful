Jar Jar Binks vs Mace Windu

The Jedi have a PR problem that needs to improve across the galaxy. The rise of the Sith poses an existential challenge
to our way of life, and if we can't get people on our side many will die or become our enemy. We already know that several planets
have been destroyed or occupied by the Sith who had neutral or negative feelings about the Jedi. This is a leading indicator for 
a civilization's collapse.

Hypothesis: send our best diplomats to improve relations, find areas of collaboration, fix grievances, and create alliances.

The test:
Jar Jar Binks and Mace Windu will advocate for building alliances over the next three months. Both advocates will receive an equal number 
favorable and unfavorable planets.

We will rate the satisfaction of each planet individually and the top-line satisfaction before the meetings and afterwards.

Measure each advocate individually.
If after meeting the Jedi advocates the satisfaction levels among favorable planets increases by 15% and unfavorable increases by 30%,
continue using whichever advocate as the main alliane builder. If both exceed those marks, then continue using both.
If only favorable or unfavorable meet their goals across both advocates, focus then on the types of planets that made a difference.
