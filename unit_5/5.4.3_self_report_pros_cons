#DRILL: When to use surveys 
State whether a survey would be the best option for answering each of the following questions.

1. Popularity of various Uber drivers. 
--> No. It is better to get a review of the individual drivers since recency bias affects the opinions about the Uber driver population.

2. A grocery store wants to know how much people like strawberry, chocolate, and vanilla ice cream. 
--> Yes. It is defined to a few flavors all provided by the store, existing customers can be easily asked, and 
the store has control of the product's quality assurance for a uniform, trustworthy survey. 

3. Trojan wants to know whether their condoms are more popular among straight people or gay people. 
--> No. the data set has two principle issue. One is survey respondents aren't uniformly likely to review their sexual identity as the other.
Secondly, straight people are outnumber gay people. So, weighting must occur. However, due to the first issue, the second issue
with weighting gets compounded.

4. Recently, rental rates for HappyCars have increased by 30%, which is quite unusual. 
You want to find out why this is happening and how to keep the increase going. 
--> Assuming the survey is going out to customers of HappyCars, yes. You would want to interview the ones who paid a premium 
and understand their preferences & experience vs the people who paid traditional rates.

5. Assessing the success rate of a new advertising campaign. 
--> No. Preference falsification, and the cost of understanding why so many people didn't buy is too high.

6. Measuring the effect of nurse/patient ratio on patient recovery rates in hospital wards.
--> you don't need a survey for this. This can be done with a series of A/B tests.
