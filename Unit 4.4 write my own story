#1 industry folk
Ideally I'd like to be in a position where I'm getting to know 1 or 2 models very well, I have exposure to machine learning as well as
decision analysis for department/company leaders, and am given the freedom to pursue my own projects that can impact the bottom line.
Industries that interest me are finance, ecommerce, venture capital, and start-ups, and new-age transportation.

I help business leaders make decisions about the about the future of their company using data and insights they already have
but they aren't clear yet. In the role itself, I'd have exposure to multiple departments and leading projects are 
directly impacting the C-Suite. I'm a trusted advisor that displays the best truth we have using evidence.
