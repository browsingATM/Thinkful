Let's say we work at a credit card company and we're trying to figure out if people are going to pay their bills on time. 
We have everyone's purchases, split into four main categories: groceries, dining out, utilities, and entertainment. 
What are some ways you might use KNN to create this model? What aspects of KNN would be useful?

different expenses have different number of occurances and price points. 
modeling how close to these clustered expenses new expenses are could help predict that model.

Example: utilities are usually 1-2 a month for each utiliy and are usually higher dollar than an average grocery bill.
grocery bills may be several times a week; entertainment will be weighted from thursday-sunday; dining out close to meal times.
