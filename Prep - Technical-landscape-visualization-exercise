I want to be able to wake up, go on a walk with my girlfriend, work out, eat breakfast,
and then get to work from my home office. I want to work on projects that are cross-industry and expose
me to new problems ideally in small to midsize companies where the work I do can have a disproportionately large impact. 
Because I have a sales background I like interacting with people, so ideally a lot of my job is working with
teammates on data anaylsis, clients who need more information, or coordinating with other parties to get the job done.
I have a feeling a lot of my work won't be training computers or AI, but rather helping people make decisions with the data at hand.
